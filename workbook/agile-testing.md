# Agile Testing

### Testing Quadrants

Testing is a complicated and deep topic. 
To help bring clarity Brian Merrick created the "Testing Quadrants."
He has separated types of testing into four domains, as in the diagram below.

Tests on the left <em>support the team</em> during development. They are used to help drive development of the product.

Tests on the right <em>critique the product</em>. They are used to verify that the product meets, and continues to meet, the requirements.

Tests on the top are <em>business facing</em>. Business can understand them, and should be interested in them.


Tests on the bottom are <em>product facing</em>. They test the product, but might not be interesting for non-technical business folks.

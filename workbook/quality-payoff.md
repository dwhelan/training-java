# Quality Payoff


### Our Hypothesis About Quality
We believe that producing quality software pays off eventually. 


### The Rewrite Trap
One of us (Shawn) worked on an application that he was really proud of. 

The original application was developed with quality in mind. The team used coninuous integration, wrote automated unit tests, and continously improved the design and processes.

The application provided great business value, and was very well received. In fact, it became so popular that the development team grew from four to forty, and then outsourced teams were added to increase productivity.

As the group grew something happened. To make it easier for teams to work independantly they started working on long-lived branches (months). Teams stopped writing new tests, and the existing tests all broke. It was impossible to improve the code because it made merges painful, so teams stopped improving the code. In order to work independantly teams duplicated chunks of code into their own modules so that they could work in isolation. People introduced different frameworks to solve their problems. At one point there were at least three different error handling frameworks in use!

Teams were held to tight deadlines, so they were never given time to improve the application.

After about eight years it became extremely hard to develop and test new features.

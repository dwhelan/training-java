# Technical Debt


### Definition of Technical Debt
The <em>technical debt</em> metaphor has become common in our industry.

Here is the wikipedia definition:

<em>“A concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.” </em>

The metaphor was created by Ward Cunningham (the inventor of the wiki, and one of the creators of <em>extreme programming</em>. 

Here is Ward's definition:

<em>“When taking short cuts and delivering code that is not quite right for the programming task of the moment, a development team incurs Technical Debt. This debt decreases productivity. This loss of productivity is the interest of the Technical Debt.”</em>

Our definition is much simpler:
<em>"Technical debt is anything that slows you down."</em>
